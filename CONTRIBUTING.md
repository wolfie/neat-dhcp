# Contributing to NeatDHCP

First off, thanks for considering contributing to the project!

Currently, the most helpful ways to contribute are, in order

1. Submitting pull requests for behavior that is against the various DHCP RFCs, or plain old logical bugs.
2. Submitting pull requests regarding the improvements or fixes mentioned in either `TODO.md` or the various `TODO` comments strewn about the repository.
3. Filing issues about behavior that is against the various DHCP RFCs, or plain old logical bugs.

Issues about new features are _accepted_, but not prioritized currently. There's a lot of basic features still to be implemented...
